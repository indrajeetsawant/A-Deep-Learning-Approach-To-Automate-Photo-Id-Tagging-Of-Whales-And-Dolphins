# A-Deep-Learning-Approach-To-Automate-Photo-Id-Tagging-Of-Whales-And-Dolphins
Using modern deep learning and computer vision
techniques, this project attempts to automate the photo id tagging
of marine creatures. Photo ID tagging necessitates a great deal of
physical labor on the part of humans, as it necessitates the tagging
of every conceivable individual marine mammal. Despite the
fact that it necessitates a significant amount of effort, time, and
resources, this process is prone to human error. Another problem
is that this method isnâ€™t scalable. We created a Convolutional
Neural Network model for predicting the Photo ID of various
Whales and Dolphins in this project. On the Kaggle happyWhale
dataset, our best model could predict the Photo Id (Individual id
as per notation in the Dataset) with a Mean Average Precision
@ 5 of 30 percent.This real-world dataset was compiled by 25
research institutions from all around the world and includes
photos of over 15,000 individuals from 30 distinct species. The
result is promising because the dataset has not been filtered for
noise or subjected to any additional preprocessing. As a result, the
datasets effectively capture the complexities of real-world data,
and we can expect similar results from any other real-world data.
